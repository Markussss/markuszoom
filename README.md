# markuszoom
Inspired by [HoverZoom+](https://github.com/extesy/hoverzoom). I'm currently just trying to create something that's almost usable. I'm still trying to figure out the best way (in my eyes) to do stuff, and things might change rapidly. I also want another name for the project, but while I'm thinking about something else, I'll stick with the current name.

As HoverZoom+ use jQuery, I wanted to create something similiar using [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
